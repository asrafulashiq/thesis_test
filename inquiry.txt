-------

1) 
    What is accelerometer data ax ay az
    How are they calculated
    Relationship between them and motion of a person
    Relationship between ax, ay, az


2)
    What is PPG
    What is ECG
    What information ECG contain
    Relationship between ECG and PPG
    Range of heart-rate


3)
    What is motion artifact
    Cause of motion artifact
    Frequency range of motion artifact
    Does accelerometer contains motion artifact data 
        if does, how and how much
        correlation between a_xyz and motion artifact
    Can motion artifact be detected clearly 


4)
    What is RLS algorithm
    How RLS algorithm can remove noise from a signal
    Can motion artifact be considered as noise
        if so, how
        is there any one-to-one relationship between motion artifact and axyz
    Is ECG signal uncorrelated with motion artifact / axyz


5)
    What are the methods existed for removing motion artifact from PPG
        Note all of them down
        Note their merits and demerits and accuracies
    Implement important methods in our code and analyze the result


6)
    What is constraint in cost function
    Study different cost function 
    Study constraint minimization
    Study Matrix calculas
    

7) 
    Develop a cost function and constraint for PPG signal to reduce motion artifact
    See the result
        if result degrades, for what assumption
        if result improves, why





THINK A LOT.....
THINKING MAKES ONE WISE......
SEE FIGURES......
SEEING IS MORE EFFICIENT THAN CALCULATING....
